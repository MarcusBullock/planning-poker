A basic planning poker implementation.

1. Users can create a session and get a link to share.

2. Users can go to a link and pick a username.

3. Once picked, the user can see a screen for that planning poker session that can be joined by anyone with the link.

4. Users then size the story anonymously, and the scores are only shown when everyone has voted.
